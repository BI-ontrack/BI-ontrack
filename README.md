- 👋 Hi, I’m Junior from BI-ontrack
- 👀 I’m interested in helping companies achieve their goals by visualizing their data and adopting a datadriven workapproach. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to obtain the MS Fabric License (data/analystics engineering), to be able to facilitate the data extraction and management proces on scale (end-to-end). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on PowerBI projects and data extraction and activation methods (live). 
- 📫 How to reach me: You can always reach my via junior@bi-ontrack.nl
- 😄 Pronouns: "Juun"
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe there is always a solution to what we want to achieve, we just have to find the best way.
